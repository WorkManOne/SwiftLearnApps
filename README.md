# Weight Index
Separated iOS and watchOS app that shows your weight index, after you put your parameters. Nothing more.
# Food Test
My first iOS app. Food test with points. This one might be weird, because of me picked wrong images and their names for test app logic.
# Task Manager
Also an app to practice my skills at creating muliple views. Allows you to create, delete and move tasks.
# Tip calc
An iOS and watchOS separated app that would help you to count how much money ðŸ’° you and your friends need to pay if you divide check.
# SwiftUI_Learn
There are some real showcases, how SwiftUi and my creativity works. I tried to experiment with all tasks I got.
